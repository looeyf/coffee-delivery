## About

This project simulates a coffee shop e-commerce, the user is able to see the available products, add them to the cart and "complete" the purchase adding payment and address info.

## How it works

The project was created using Node v22.13.1 and Vite

### Pre-requisites

Firstly, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), latest stable release of [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (22.18.0 to the present date).

- With git installed, please clone this repository

In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### With everything installed, the following steps, you must do

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
$ cd coffee-delivery

# Install project dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the dev environment
